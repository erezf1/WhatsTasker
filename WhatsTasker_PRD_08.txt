WhatsTasker: Product Requirements (v0.8 - Orchestrator Focused)
🧭 Overview
WhatsTasker is a personal productivity assistant designed for individuals seeking to manage their daily items (tasks, reminders, and todos), improve focus, and reduce procrastination through a conversational interface. Accessed via WhatsApp, it functions as an intelligent Time Management Expert, integrating directly with the user's primary calendar (initially Google Calendar for scheduled Tasks and timed Reminders) and utilizing an internal metadata store for enhanced tracking of all items. WhatsTasker aims to streamline daily planning, facilitate frictionless capture of intentions, and support helpful routines.
🌟 Core System Goal
The system shall act as a proactive and intelligent Time Management Expert. It must understand user context (history, preferences, schedule, items), interpret requests accurately, facilitate effective item and schedule management, and anticipate user needs where feasible within the defined scope, moving beyond simple command execution.

🔑 Core Functional Requirements
1. Multi-User Support & Identification:
   * Uniquely identify users via their WhatsApp phone number (user_id).
   * Maintain consistent user_id linkage across all system components.
2. Item & Reminder Management (Calendar-Based for some):
   * **Supported Item Types:** The system will support three primary item types:
      *   **Reminder:** An alert for a specific date and (optional) time. Timed Reminders are synchronized with the user's primary calendar. Untimed Reminders default to the user's work start time for listing purposes but do not create calendar events.
      *   **Task:** An actionable item requiring dedicated effort and time, for which the system helps schedule work sessions in the user's primary calendar. Tasks have a description, due date/timeframe, and estimated total duration.
      *   **ToDo:** A simple actionable item that the user wants to track, which may or may not have a due date and does not have system-scheduled calendar time. ToDos are managed within WhatsTasker's internal store.
   * Direct Calendar Integration: Synchronize confirmed **Tasks** (as scheduled work sessions) and timed **Reminders** with the user's designated primary calendar (initially Google Calendar). **ToDos** are not synchronized with the calendar.
   * Metadata Augmentation: Maintain an internal metadata store linked to calendar events (for Tasks/Reminders) or internal IDs (for ToDos and untimed Reminders) to track additional details crucial for system operation (e.g., item status [pending, in progress, completed, cancelled], type [task, reminder, todo], estimated effort [for tasks], project tags, timestamps, due dates).
3. Natural Language Interaction (via WhatsApp):
   * Conversational Interface: Enable users to interact using free-form, natural language commands and requests.
   * Contextual Understanding: Maintain and utilize conversational context (recent history, user state) to understand follow-up questions, resolve ambiguities, and provide relevant, coherent responses.
4. User Capabilities & Outcomes:
   * Onboarding: Guide new users through an initial setup process to configure essential preferences (e.g., work parameters, calendar connection authorization) and activate their account.
   * Item Capture & Classification:
      * Allow users to efficiently capture intentions (tasks, reminders, todos) via natural language.
      * Intelligently distinguish between simple **Reminders** (typically requiring only description and date/time), effortful **Tasks** (implying duration/effort and eligibility for scheduling work sessions), and basic **ToDos** (requiring only a description, with optional due date, but no scheduled work time).
      * Reliably extract key details: description, due date/time, type (task, reminder, or todo), and estimated effort (for tasks).
   * Item Modification: Enable users to accurately modify details of existing items (tasks, reminders, or todos) (e.g., description, due date/time, status, estimated effort for tasks) based on their requests.
   * Item Status Updates: Allow users to easily update the status of items (e.g., mark as completed, pending), including handling interactive replies to system-generated lists.
   * Item Viewing & Filtering: Enable users to view their items (tasks, reminders, and todos), with options to filter by relevant criteria such as date range, status (active, completed, etc.), or an associated project tag/label.
   * Clarification Handling: Intelligently request clarification from the user when input is ambiguous, incomplete, or conflicts with existing information, guiding the user towards providing necessary details.
   * Task Scheduling Assistance (for Type: Task only):
      * Proactively offer to find and schedule dedicated work time in the calendar for newly created Tasks (unless scheduling was part of the initial request).
      * Upon user request, propose suitable, potentially distributed, time slots for Tasks requiring work sessions, considering task requirements, user preferences, and calendar availability.
      * Allow users to easily confirm and book proposed work session slots into their calendar.
5. Automated Routines & Summaries:
   * Morning Check-in: Provide a concise overview of the user's upcoming day, including scheduled calendar events, due **Tasks**, **Reminders**, and **ToDos**. Goal: Enhance daily awareness and readiness.
   * Evening Review: Facilitate a quick end-of-day review:
      * Present **Tasks**, **Reminders**, and **ToDos** scheduled for or due that day.
      * Allow users to easily update the completion status of these items.
      * For **Tasks** identified as incomplete, prompt the user (optionally asking for a reason) and proactively offer to reschedule the task or its remaining work, potentially suggesting new time slots. Goal: Prevent tasks from being dropped and adapt planning.
   * 6. Fallback Operation:
   * Support basic item management (capture, status updates, viewing lists for Reminders, Tasks, and ToDos) even without calendar integration. Smart scheduling proposals for Tasks, calendar-based summaries for Tasks/timed Reminders, and rescheduling offers for Tasks will be unavailable in this mode.
💡 Future Capabilities (Beyond Initial Scope)
* Advanced Scheduling Intelligence (Optimal times, breaks, conflict handling)
* Proactive Time Management Advice & Goal Tracking
* Weekly Reflection Module (Structured prompts, insight storage)
* Recurring Item Support (Tasks, Reminders, ToDos)
* Advanced Daily Planning Assistance ("Just One Thing", backlog suggestions)
* Timed Pre-Event Notifications (Requires external scheduler) - *Applies to Reminders and scheduled Task sessions*
* Shared/Team Task Collaboration Features
* Expanded Calendar Integrations (Outlook, etc.)
* User Subscription Tiers & Monetization
⚠️ MVP Scope & Limitations (Initial Release)
* Calendar: Integration only with Google Calendar; one active calendar per user.
* Item Types: No built-in support for recurring items (tasks, reminders, todos).
* Collaboration: No shared items or team features.
* Proactivity: Limited to offering scheduling for new Tasks and rescheduling incomplete Tasks in the evening review. No broader unsolicited advice.
* Notifications: Timed pre-event notifications are in scope for Reminders and scheduled Task sessions.
* Reflection: Weekly reflection module is out of scope.
* Monetization: No user plans or payments.
✅ Acceptance Criteria (High-Level)
* Users can successfully onboard, configure preferences, and connect their Google Calendar.
* The system correctly distinguishes between **Tasks**, **Reminders**, and **ToDos** based on user input.
* Users can reliably create, view (with date/status/project filters), update, and mark items (tasks, reminders, todos) as complete via natural language.
* The system proactively offers scheduling for newly created **Tasks**.
* The system can propose schedule slots for **Tasks** based on calendar availability and preferences, and book confirmed slots.
* The system provides functional Morning Check-in and Evening Review summaries, which include relevant **ToDos**.
* The Evening Review correctly identifies incomplete **Tasks** and offers rescheduling options.
* The system handles clarifications when user input is ambiguous.
* Basic reminder and ToDo functionality works without calendar integration. Task scheduling is degraded.
