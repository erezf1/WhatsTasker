  Hello! 👋 Ready to take control of your time and focus? Welcome to WhatsTasker!
  Imagine having a personal Time Management Expert right here in WhatsApp, helping you:
  🧠 **Capture Everything Instantly:** Just text me your tasks and reminders like you normally would – "remind me about the team sync at 10", "add task finish the report by Friday, takes about 3 hours". No more switching apps!
  📅 **Stay Aligned with Your Calendar:** I connect directly to your Google Calendar, ensuring your tasks and scheduled work time fit seamlessly into your day.
  ⏱️ **Beat Procrastination:** Need focused time for important tasks? I can find empty slots in your calendar and block out dedicated work sessions for you.
  ☀️ **Start Strong, End Clear:** Get ahead with helpful morning check-ins and wrap up your day effectively with quick evening reviews to ensure nothing falls through the cracks (coming soon!).
  Think of me as your partner in productivity, helping you plan better, focus deeply, and get more done with less stress.
